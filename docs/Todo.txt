TODO short term
get rid of ' in webview type selectors

Generics.replace what is this, also for label or other widgets?
present LabelView not implemented

edit on LabelView? (will need to implement Generics.replace) 



Longer term
errors in script are not reported other than failing to present. Should log them to console

Naming
Text/TextView
RadioView 

in Main, we get (Widget Text), (Widget RadioView) etc. these will get type synonyms Text... etc.
The synonyms should be consistent with the naming in Types
 


Possible bugs
 Drag & drop code may interfere with hList and vList spacings



Scripting:
- Handle escaping, emitting the string </WebViewsJavaScript> will crash 
- Maybe we can create a special WebNode for scripts? Might make it easier to present them automatically and won't require the extraction.
   It would require changing Incrementality though.
