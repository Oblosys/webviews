TVar or MVar instead of IORef (or maybe use atomicModifyIORef)


Widget with lens

Widget stubId id ParentViewID


on SetC id str
change Widget _ id pvid lens someWidget{value=read str}
updateView pvid lens (read str)



use case:

create widget with init value
access in edit monad or in presentation

so widget needs a copy of the value

Do we need a lens?
Maybe the property thing can access the widgets on a change.

when to update the widget on an external property change?

use case:

property widget with present and parse functions + lens; to view


use case:
check how radio has to access oldvalue, maybe more clear than textview.


Fact: property needs to access widget to show whether value parses. Passing old value is awkward, as they are typically
created as a list.
Fact: don't want to wrap editable property in a webview because we want to customize its presentation.
unclear: setting textfield does not change existing textfield? should it?
