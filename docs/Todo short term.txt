TVar or MVar instead of IORef (or maybe use atomicModifyIORef)

Optimization: Lock sessions server-side, instead of waiting client-side for the results until sending new commands.
- when allowing several commands to be queued, check that session handles this. Right now, if the sessionId doesn't
  exist, a new session is created. If several commands can be underway, this may happen multiple times.

Check if simultaneous access to database doesn't cause any problems.

Check jMacro for representing JavaScript

Widget with lens

Widget stubId id ParentViewID


on SetC id str
change Widget _ id pvid lens someWidget{value=read str}
updateView pvid lens (read str)



use case:

create widget with init value
access in edit monad or in presentation

so widget needs a copy of the value

Do we need a lens?
Maybe the property thing can access the widgets on a change.

when to update the widget on an external property change?

use case:

property widget with present and parse functions + lens; to view


use case:
check how radio has to access oldvalue, maybe more clear than textview.


Fact: property needs to access widget to show whether value parses. Passing old value is awkward, as they are typically
created as a list.
Fact: don't want to wrap editable property in a webview because we want to customize its presentation.
unclear: setting textfield does not change existing textfield? should it?
