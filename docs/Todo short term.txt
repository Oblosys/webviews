TVar or MVar instead of IORef (or maybe use atomicModifyIORef)


Widget with lens

Widget stubId id ParentViewID


on SetC id str
change Widget _ id pvid lens someWidget{value=read str}
updateView pvid lens (read str)



use case:

create widget with init value
access in edit monad or in presentation

so widget needs a copy of the value

Do we need a lens?
Maybe the property thing can access the widgets on a change.

when to update the widget on an external property change?

use case:

property widget with present and parse functions + lens; to view
